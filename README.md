# 📌 Machine Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to **Machine Learning**, covering all major types of ML techniques. It contains **Jupyter Notebook examples** for each type of machine learning, including **Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning**. Each notebook provides hands-on implementation with real-world datasets, detailed explanations, and best practices.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **📁 Supervised Learning**  
  - Regression (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)  
  - Classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)  
- **📁 Unsupervised Learning**  
  - Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)  
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)  
- **📁 Semi-Supervised Learning**  
  - Self-training, Label Propagation  
- **📁 Reinforcement Learning**  
  - Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient  

Each notebook is well-documented, with **code walkthroughs, visualizations, and theoretical insights** to help users understand and implement machine learning models effectively.
